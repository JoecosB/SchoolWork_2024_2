# SchoolWork_2024_2
 School's machine vision stuff. I tried to use object-oriented method to do the job, but the outcome doesn't look good for I may used it in a wrong way. Though a failure it is, i still learned somrthing about the method, which i will perform better next time.
## Intro
 This is a homework for machine vision, which I'm asked to code to recognize answersheets. The format of the answersheet is fixed, so it isn't hard work for me to figure out the way to do it.
