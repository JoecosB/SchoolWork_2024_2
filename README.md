# SchoolWork_2024_2
 School's machine vision stuff. I tried to use object-oriented method to do the job, but the outcome doesn't look good for I may used it in a wrong way. Though a failure it is, i still learned somrthing about the method, which i will perform better next time.
 
## Intro
  This project provides an automated tool for processing and grading multiple-choice answer sheets. It utilizes OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to detect answers, compare them against a provided answer key, and generate marked copies of the sheets with grading insights. The tool handles image preprocessing, contour detection for sheet alignment, answer detection, and grading.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you can run the Answer Sheet Grader, you must have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.6 or later is recommended). Additionally, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installing Dependencies
To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
